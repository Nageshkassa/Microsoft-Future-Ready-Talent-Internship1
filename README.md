Problem Statement/ Opportunity*  : The lack of easily accessible and comprehensive resources for 
                                  individuals who want to learn programming languages poses a significant 
                                  challenge for learners and students. Traditional learning methods, 
                                  such as physical books or offline courses, may have limitations in terms 
                                 of availability, accessibility, and up-to-date content. This results in a 
                                 gap in the availability of valuable learning materials that can support 
                                  learners in acquiring programming language skills effectively.
